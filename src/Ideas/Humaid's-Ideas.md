# Humaid's Ideas

- Security ideas
  - Two factor authentication
  - Ability to list/audit sessions of users
  - Log actions, with timestamps, etc


- Record the following stats
  - How many times the house entrance door is opened
  - How many times the fridge/freezer is opened
  - How long the shower is used for
  - Which windows are open, and for how long
  - Which appliances, devices, and accessories are running in the house. This
    includes lights, TVs, and chargers.


- Module Marketplace
  - This market place allows users to install modules/plugins to their system,
  just like browser extensions, but for the home.
  - Maybe an open-source API, so people can hack it to make it their own.
  - They can install "premium" modules, which they can install by contacting
  a contractor. For example they might want additional lighting, or a smart
  crock pot/rice cooker which works with the system.
  - We can use [Go's plugins package](https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/).
