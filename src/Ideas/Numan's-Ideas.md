# Numan's Ideas

### General Ideas for the Application - 

**Gamification:**
-  Set target limits for energy consumption. Contextual tips and suggestions for achieving the set target.
-  Gain points or an energy rating based on how low energy consumption has been. Achievements/badges can be unlocked.
-  Compare your points/rating with friends (via social media etc) or energy consumption with neighbourhood (through national grid). 
-  Possible money incentive - energy bill savings in vouchers.

**User Experience:**
-  Select a home type, small home (apartments, flats, 1/2 bedroom etc), regular home (3/4 bed) and large (5+ bed). Can help to make the app better tailored to the user. Maybe even new or old home, limiting certain functions of the app.
-  Different modes e.g. holiday mode. App puts lights on at night and turns of all other automations storing as much energy as possible.
-  Home managers can set permissions for other user groups e.g. guest group for... guests.

**UI & Naming** 
-  Home screen with latest energy stats and suggested controls based on time, temp, past behaviour. 
-  Live smart - possible app name.
-  Samsung's Smartthings app has clean a UI.
-  Smart meter inspired graphs -
