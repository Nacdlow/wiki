## Meeting

@RuaridhMollica explained the Gantt chart, demonstrating a couple of features of [TeamGantt](https://teamgantt.com).

@humaid discussed the tooling set we are going to use for Go development, and how to make the most
of the tools available, and integrating it with Continuous Integration. He also briefly discussed about GoDoc
generation and Git Merging.

We also discussed about buying a domain and how to setup and deploy websites. @humaid proposed:
- For buying domains [NameCheap](https://namecheap.com) is a good seller.
- For hosting dynamic web apps [Heroku](https://heroku.com) is a good free host.
- For static site hosting, [Netlify](netlify.com) is a good choice.
