# 16th October Meeting

This meeting will take place at 1:30pm.

## Agenda

- Discuss what we will use for our website (Wordpress?)
- Discuss how we should keep the project at the end. So we have consensus on
  releasing the project open-source, and keeping the domain alive after the
  year (so we can link it on our portfolios/CV).  
- Explain the structure of Go project.

## Meeting | 13:30

### Website for Stage 2
Undecided for now. Deal with later. However try to minimise code use to save time
