Everyone was asked how they are getting on. No issues so far.


### Usability Testing | Time
We are unsure as to how exactly the usability testing will be conducted, however we know that the spec requires at least 6 people. We are planning on getting a small group of poeple to test a few designs of our app once we have the mockups 


## To-Do
- If you find an uncompleted/unassigned section in the stage 1 reports, consider assigning yourself to it
- A basic mockup of the PWA must be created by next week or the week after
